### Delegate Statement

#### Mission

ConsenSys is devoted to supporting the growth and development of Web3. Through the development of blockchain technology, we are shaping a future world of open access, transparency, and inclusion. We are decidedly focused on improving systems, businesses, and the lives of every person in the world.

#### Values

As an organization, we see a resounding need to ensure the growth of our ecosystem through some of the core values it is founded on. ConsenSys shares these core values when applying governance analysis, communication, and decision-making.

These values include:

* Decentralization
* Sovereign individualism
* Transparency
* Accountability
* Authenticity
* Open-source contribution

#### Introduction

ConsenSys is recognized as an Ethereum software company. Together, we assist people and enterprises worldwide in developing innovative software, building core infrastructure, implementing innovative financial systems, and gaining access to the distributed web. As the industry matures, we believe it is important to participate in delegation to create positive outcomes on behalf of the industry.

We face new challenges in DAOs. These challenges include macroeconomics, operations, and specialized finance topics. We aim to leverage our diverse resources to help streamline this dynamic landscape. Through extensive outreach and research in the ecosystem, ConsenSys understands Maker's complexities and challenges. We are also uniquely positioned to support and protect the advancement of the protocol.

*Collectively, ConsenSys is here to work through every proposal, problem, success, and failure.*

#### Voting

Delegation is something that we believe is an essential part of DeFi. Our priority is the longevity of the community and protocol.

Consensys leverages values first principles when analysing governance decisions. We will use the same internal core framework while evaluating proposals during our delegation.

We also value transparent communication through all available mediums to us. We look forward to meeting you all through office hours, twitter spaces, discord calls, and more.
