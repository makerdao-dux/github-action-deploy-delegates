### Core Values 

- **Growth:** I am in support of initiatives that enable broader DAI adoption and that attempt to reduce concentration risks, such as USDC reliance. The DAI peg is important to my platform; as a stablecoin, we must comply with DAI holders’ expectations.  
- **Revenue:** Developing core, complementary products to ensure that revenue is stable, not seasonal, and attempting to eliminate market-driven volatility from the DAO’s bottom line. To achieve this, we need strong ALM, RWF and DAI use cases.  
- **Data-Driven:** With core products (PSM, Vault Lending, RWF, DAI L1/L2 adoption) running smoothly, MKR has a trove of data and bandwidth to test new features and products to remain competitive and innovative.  
- **Unbiased:** I participate in open discussions and working sessions from all MakerDAO participants, while practicing and promoting disciplined productivity. Initiatives such as Proof Of Humanity or Gitcoin Passport will be seen positively by my platform.

### Delegate Statement

My objective for becoming a delegate is to support growth initiatives that will lead to **broader DAI adoption and bring value to MKR token holders**. I view product rollouts, innovative ideas and DAI adoption (i.e., expanding DAI use cases) very favorably.  By expanding DAI use cases and therefore DAI holders, we benefit from potential organic revenue growth. In addition, we support MakerDAO in its mission to turn DAI into the main digital currency, while maintaining its core values as unbiased, decentralized and asset-backed. **The DAO’s mission can only be accomplished with a healthy liquidity buffer that will enable it to experiment, test and adapt to a rapidly changing world.**

**Another key aspect of my objective in becoming a delegate is my passion for financial education and equitable access.** While TradFi thrives on uninformed participants and limited availability of products (i.e., the privileged few with resources and connections), MakerDAO can support users new to the financial system by using data-based lending services to offer transparent products and prices. In addition, via MakerDAO’s forum, we provide crypto education and a welcoming community to existing and new users.  I believe MakerDAO’s product should remain accessible and fair to all participants, even if that is at the expense of potential revenue growth; we should be able to develop opportunities that all can access because in the long-run, that will be better for user adoption and growth. 

I grew up in an Emerging Market, where I witnessed firsthand the impact of fiscally irresponsible and corrupt governments on hard-working communities. These feelings of injustice and experiences in my childhood led me to pursue a career in financial services.  My background in TradFi (capital markets at large, global banks) and as a small business owner gives me the knowledge necessary to participate in finance, sales, marketing and product management-related governance polls for MakerDAO. In addition, with my persistent curiosity, I educate myself on topics relevant to the DAO. 

**My past posts and comments should allow you to understand my vision for the protocol, such as growth in DAI demand, sound ALM business practices, new features for revenue-generation, analysis of market opportunities (L1/L2, Argentina and El Salvador) and innovation for the flagship product (crypto-backed loans).** In my view, the key to DAI’s success is to successfully diversify DAI’s collateral, use cases, counterparties and holders. To the extent another MakerDAO community member aligns with my views, I would be happy to consider partnering as a delegate team.

To demonstrate my alignment with the protocol, I would invest the majority of any DAI compensation earned as a delegate back into MKR.

### Code of Conduct

As a delegate, I commit to abide by the protocol’s [code of conduct](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/recognised-delegate-code-of-conduct/9384) and to provide dedication, respect and transparency to the entire MKR community. 

### Conflicts of Interest 

I own ETH, MKR and other ERC20 tokens, which in aggregate represent less than 10% of my assets. I am not financially compensated by any other crypto project; if that changes (which I do not expect it to), I will inform the protocol in this post. I do not derive income from any potential partner or competitor of MakerDAO.

### Waiver of Liability

By delegating to me, you acknowledge and agree that I participate on a best efforts basis and will not be liable for any form of damages related to my participation in the Maker Protocol or MakerDAO.
