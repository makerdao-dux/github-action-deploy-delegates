### Delegate Statement

Hey Maker Community,

I met @tyler in Denver while chatting about DAO infrastructure and the importance of governance.

He mentioned the newly formed recognized delegate program and compensation structure. At the time, my thought was "how do we get involved??"\

Well, here we are! Bravo team.

Flipside Crypto and its dedicated governance team (Flipside Governance) would like to serve as a delegate for Maker.

Maker has been an inspiration to the ETH community and larger crypto ecosystem, and we view Maker as an integral part of DeFi and a luminary for user adoption.

#### *Who is Flipside Governance?*

Flipside Governance, an arm of Flipside Crypto, was established in September 2021 to directly support, contribute, and drive participation in our partner  communities - helping improve the efficiency of this critical piece of protocol health. 

We operate in Aave, SushiSwap, ENS DAO, as well as Mango Markets, Osmosis, Marinade and Optimism. We are committed to using our experience to improve DAOs one proposal at a time.

We are one of the few full-time governance teams dedicated to the complete Web3 ecosystem. We have developed a key understanding of the needs and flow of information in the governance process and key tooling to be successful.

A few of our results thus far are as follows:
 
* Passed a $1,000,000 SushiSwap Grant, with 99.83% votes in favor
* Won awards for activity in Aave, Anchor, and SushiSwap Forums (New User of the Month)
* Review Committee Member at Aave Grants DAO
* Transferability Committee Member at Paladin Vote
* Applied and received ENS DAO & Paladin delegation, representing 6k+ delegated votes
* Active voting in multiple ecosystems: Aave, Sushi, ENS DAO, Optimism, Algorand, and more
* Research extensively on emerging and legacy Governance structures (SNX, ILV)
* Active in over a dozen forums, like Optimism Governance, Aave Governance.
* Won multiple grants from Compound, Uniswap, and Aave

#### *Why seek delegation for Maker?*

We have experienced firsthand the difficulties of protocol governance and the intricacies of holding voting power. Maker not only rewards informed voting through "recognized delegation" and clear documentation, but $DAI aims to create an unbiased monetary system. There is plenty of room for improved proposals, a greater understanding of the governance landscape, and relationships with key players and stakeholders. Flipside Governance spends every waking hour focused on exactly this, and we are very excited about the prospect of bringing our expertise to the Maker ecosystem.\

***What we appreciate about Maker?***

We believe governance is best achieved through:

1. Proper education (what votes mean and why)
2. Fairly distributed voting power and incentivising small holders to participate
3. Engaged, rewarded community members

Maker helps improve these three things through a modern framework to delegation. Recognized Delegates, as pioneered by Maker, and paying contributors for their efforts are necessary steps in an engaged and mature governance process.

Flipside Governance aligns with this mission and would be honored to help improve processes within the DAO & protocol and bring valuable resources to Maker. By selecting us as delegates, we aim to represent the views of a range of users and provide analytics to justify our data-driven decisions. Together with the Maker community, we can create a stronger, more efficient governance process in Maker and partner protocols.

**Conclusion**

As delegates, we promise:

* Constant monitoring of votes and participation in each vote
* Open discussion and contribution to the DAO forum and Discord
* Transparency about when we vote and how we vote
* A shared commitment to the future success of Maker

Here are a few of our coolest things we've done in Crypto:

### Conflicts of Interest

We are active delegates of Aave, but have addressed the conflict of interest by assigning different persons to spearhead efforts in the relevant DAOs.
