### Delegates Code of Conduct:

We as RiskDAO and its core contributors have read, acknowledge and adhere to Maker’s Delegate Code of Conduct. (Agreed 28 September 2022).

### Core Values

* **Rigorous risk frameworks:** RiskDAO members think critically about risk factors and attack vectors of DeFi lending protocols. Among other things, we have developed a bad debt dashboard that sheds light into risk management practices of major lending protocols. We will apply this mindset to each and every discussion as a MakerDAO Delegate.
* **Hands on technical knowledge of the MakerDAO system:** the RiskDAO consists of both risk analysts and smart contract developers. Some of the smart contract developers have deep understanding of the MakerDAO dss system, and previously spotted some flaws in the system.
* **Proactive approach:** We think proactively, simulate and analyze potential bugs and exploit vectors before they arise. We don’t want to be called in, when it’s too late but rather point out potential issues before they arise. A recent example is the bug exposure for [Moonwell cToken market](https://medium.com/risk-dao/the-risk-of-secondary-markets-for-depegged-collateral-tokens-moonwell-bug-disclosure-2021181f50bc).
* **Open source & Collaborative:** We work in public and publish code and findings accordingly. We employ a highly collaborative approach with protocols and teams.
* **Diverse contributor base:** We are an international community of contributors with a diverse skill set and have capabilities in smart contract programming, risk analyses, financial services and governance.
* **Accountability and responsibility:** We are fully committed to serving the best interests and needs of MakerDAO, its tokenholders and community. We want to drive protocol growth, whilst minimizing risks to the protocol.
* **DeFi native:** RiskDAO is set up specifically to make users more knowledgeable about how lending markets work, and the risk involved.

### Delegate Statement

We consider MakerDAO one of the most important DeFi primitives and actively want to shape its future direction. We are aware that protocol governance touches on numerous topics and consider ourselves perfectly suited to add substantial insights and benefits to public debate and decision-making processes.

RiskDAO was created in May 2022 by DeFi protocol B.Protocol and by the research arm of 1kx, as the first DAO fully dedicated to creating open source risk management tools for DeFi. Recently, La Tribu, former contributing dev team of the Tribe DAO also started to contribute to the RiskDAO.

We have grown rapidly as a DAO and are continuously delivering on our core values. This means we have seen an increase in projects & collaborations, onboarded contributors, published more research to generate insights into strong vs weak system designs.

#### Previous contribution to the MakerDAO ecosystem:

* Tracking MakerDAO’s bad debt in the [Bad debt ](https://bad-debt.riskdao.org/) dashboard.
* B.Protocol team [alerted](https://twitter.com/CoinDesk/status/1328338322306064384?t=NgZCvMfsl1RbksfkBtffJQ&s=09) about low dust levels for ETH-A collateral, and provided a [detailed analysis](https://medium.com/b-protocol/the-keepers-dilemma-game-theoretic-analysis-of-liquidation-incentives-with-preliminary-b588e82e4d67), which consequently led to a [decision](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/small-vaults-liquidations-incentives/5166) to increase the dust level.
* B.Protocol’s front end features an interface to the MakerDAO vault system.
* B.Protocol submitted a collateral on-boarding [MIP](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip13c3-sp11-onboarding-a-new-collateral-type-backed-by-b-protocol-v2-declaration-of-intent/8802) with an implementation of an alternative liquidation mechanism for MakerDAO.
* The La Tribu dev team intensively worked on FEI<>DAI integration when it was contributing to the Tribe DAO.
* B.Protocol did a [security audit](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip59-dsscharter/10028/5) for a MakerDAO’s smart contract module.
* In his previous position in 2018, a team member of B.Protocol integrated Kyber Network DEX to aggregate Oasis DEX order book for DAI/ETH orders.

#### Other contributions to the DeFi ecosystem include:

* [Bad debt ](https://bad-debt.riskdao.org/) & [ETH depegging](https://depeg.riskdao.org/) dashboards
* [Risk parametrization risk analysis for Vesta Finance](https://medium.com/risk-dao/vesta-finance-system-parameterization-risk-analysis-b52aaf7b56e5)
* [Market price analysis for multi-layer DeFi scheme](https://twitter.com/Risk_DAO/status/1565700802685145088?s=20&t=n-LxtEhk9-irNL35Kr6Zxw)
* [Liquidation events simulator](https://medium.com/risk-dao/using-the-riskdao-simulation-gui-2aaffd6c5792)
* [Aurigami Dashboard](https://aurigami.riskdao.org/#system-status)
* [Moonwell bug bounty](https://medium.com/risk-dao/the-risk-of-secondary-markets-for-depegged-collateral-tokens-moonwell-bug-disclosure-2021181f50bc)
* [Joint research with Myso Finance ](https://medium.com/risk-dao/on-insolvency-tackling-bad-debt-in-defi-6c2ac5028348)
* [Vesta Finance risk simulation](https://medium.com/risk-dao/using-the-riskdao-simulation-gui-2aaffd6c5792)
* [Bounty by Liquity for their Chicken Bonds: Create a methodology to ascertain fair value](https://twitter.com/Risk_DAO/status/1565700802685145088?s=20&t=n-LxtEhk9-irNL35Kr6Zxw)

RiskDAO focuses on protocol-specific risks, primarily to avoid bad debt. Given the increase in cross-chain activity, the risk framework has been broadened to account for risk vectors from cross-chain exposure.

A description of our works is available on our [website](https://riskdao.org/) and [blog](https://medium.com/risk-dao).

#### Vision for MakerDAO

RiskDAO is also going through the process of implementing DAO structures. This involves creating open source code & risk frameworks, community development and contributor onboarding.

We are an agile organization that can adapt to MakerDAO’s future: RiskDAO will be a highly valuable Delegate both in the existing state or if Maker transitions to the “endgame” structure.

#### Operational implementation

RiskDAO’s vote will be coordinated by nonstopTheo who also serves as your point of contact for any questions. We employ strict internal communication processes: All votes will be discussed internally first before published to the public forum.

#### Conflicts of Interest

* The RiskDAO is giving risk assessment service to other lending markets and stablecoin platforms.
* B.Protocol has a pending [MIP](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip13c3-sp11-onboarding-a-new-collateral-type-backed-by-b-protocol-v2-declaration-of-intent/8802) that will benefit B.Protocol. However, it is no longer actively pursued.

#### Disclosure

*This section discloses previous interactions between B.Protocol and Maker for full transparency, given that members of RiskDAO are contributors to B.Protocol. There are no conflicts of interests from these past actions.*

* One of B.Protocol’s contributors set a precedent in 2020 by using a flash loan to influence a governance vote. The issue has been discussed at length and lessons have been learnt.
