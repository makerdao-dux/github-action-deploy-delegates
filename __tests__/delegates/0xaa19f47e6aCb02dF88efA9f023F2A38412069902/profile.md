### Our values and initiatives

#### Helping MakerDAO craft a growth strategy

Market downturns are the best time for fundamentally strong protocols like MakerDAO to capture market share and grow against the wind.

First, we view the future of DAI as increasingly B2B instead of B2C (which most crypto protocols are today). In the crypto context, this means DAO-to-DAO. MakerDAO can become the wholesale lender for all of DeFi who distributes DAI through their channels – we are seeing the first steps of this with the Aave, Compound TrueFi, and Maple D3M modules.

We recognize the ongoing discussion relating to fundraising and want to take an active role in assisting with the process. If there’s a fundraise, in no scenario should it dilute MKR holders. There should be a clear data-driven cost/benefit analysis on the need for a capital raise.

The lack of excitement and engagement from outside of the Maker community is a large problem. Reasons for this need to be discussed, including the idea of bringing more utility to the MKR token.

As an example, [stkMKR proposed by monetsupply](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/stkmkr-maker-staking-and-tokenomics-revision/13890?u=monet-supply) would bring a more enticing token economic model with arguably no downside to the project. Even if this is not the priority today, it’s clear that an update is required and would improve the system. A buy-and-burn mechanism is good — especially when prices are low leading to more MKR being burned — but stkMKR would offer better reward targeting, security, and potentially a stronger narrative.

#### Supporting a scalable DAO model

A key reason we are doing this is that Maker governance needs more active delegates with enough weight to have an impact on the overall results and to drive new initiatives that don’t necessarily originate from Maker core team members. Voter apathy is a huge issue. At one of the governance meetings, it was reported that 2 entities had 90% of the active voting power.

Hasu has pointed out that MakerDAO suffers from the principal-agent problem. Core Units aren’t always aligned with the interests of MKR holders. Establishing trust between MKR holders and the Core Units is key going forward. The Core Units are often doing a great job but even then, MKR holders aren’t finding out about it. The relationship between MKR holders and Core Units shouldn’t be adversarial – in fact, it should be the opposite.

Maker is currently unprofitable. This doesn’t necessarily mean that resources should be cut, but now is a good opportunity for further analysis and ensure that goals to help Maker scale are being prioritized correctly. The current market environment highlights the need for financial discipline – now and in the future.

We want to help get Maker ready for growth when the opportunity arises. This means scalable processes and using Maker’s inherent advantages to drive demand — such as low-interest rates to outcompete others.

## Conflicts of Interest

* We don’t have any investments or incentives that should impact our role as a delegate at the current time.
* MKR has been one of our core holdings for a long time. We consider ourselves very strongly aligned with the long-term success of the project.
* We have also read, and agree with, the [Recognised Delegate Code of Conduct](https://manual.makerdao.com/governance/what-is-delegation/delegates-code).
