### Core Values

* Further educate Blockchain@Columbia about the Maker DAO community
* Stress the importance of over collateralized stable coins like Dai particularly after recent events. 
* Advise and support Maker with Treasury Management initiatives
* Establish dynamic exchanges between innovate teams like Maker and its partners to further encourage Web-3 growth. 

### Delegate Statement
[Blockchain@Columbia](https://www.notion.so/blockchainatcolumbia/Blockchain-Columbia-fdebb7c982e849f5afa2a474eb1a71f7) is Columbia Universityâ€™s premier non-profit blockchain organization focusing on educating and empowering crypto builders, researchers, and creators.

We launched the first student group DAO, [Lion DAO](https://blockchain.mirror.xyz/d2pxavq9Bztp6kCzF9UjtoJEnFTY9Oks3RPkrcBUsKg), in 2021. Some DAO activities include a grants program which encourages [Web-3 research](https://blockchain.mirror.xyz/). Our annual conference, [Ledgerfest](https://ledgerfest.info/), focused on crypto and web3 founders from Arbitrum, Polygon, Cosmos, Drift, Audius, and more! We host weekly speakers like Aave's Founder Stani, Nansen's Founder Alex, and we host weekly technical blockchain and development workshops.

This spring we organized a 3-day hackathon, [Lionhack](https://www.lionhack.xyz/), for students and other builders in the space to help onboard more people to crypto and incubate new projects in the space. We are strong supporters of innovative Defi projects, and we are big believers in Maker DAO. Given our experience in our own DAO's governance as well as in Uniswap, Compound, and dYdX, we believe that we are strongly equipped to act as a neutral and effective governance delegate for the Maker community. 


Other governance initiatives involve:

* Staying active within discussion forums
* Drafting new proposals when appropriate
* Putting out tweet threads on active proposals
* Building relations with partnering protocols. 
* Hosting speaker events.

### Recent Governance activity

* [DRC: Increase Fee Weight Parameter](https://snapshot.org/#/dydxgov.eth/proposal/0xce4b1334f337975a42c3f78dd16fb25e0b60e816a2d9382e402b5384bea37475)
* [A Step Towards a More Equitable Liquidity Provider Reward Structure](https://commonwealth.im/dydx/discussion/4407-a-step-towards-a-more-equitable-liquidity-provider-reward-structure)
* [Risk Parameter Updates for 7 Collateral Assets](https://compound.finance/governance/proposals/106)
* [Grant request for launching Compound with Aztec Connect](https://compound.finance/governance/proposals/105)


As a university blockchain organization, we believe governance forums are one of the best ways to foster active learning in web-3. This is why we're really excited to present our candidacy to work with Maker DAO. 

### Possible Conflicts of Interest

* Blockchain@Columbia takes part actively in the governance of other well known projects
