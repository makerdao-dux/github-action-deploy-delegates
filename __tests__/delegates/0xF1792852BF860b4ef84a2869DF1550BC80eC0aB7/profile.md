### Delegate Statement

#### Brief Introduction

The LBS Blockchain society is a student and professional society at the London Business School, set up to empower the LBS community with all opportunities of the fast growing crypto / Web3 industry through education, workshops and networking events. The LBS Blockchain Society is the fastest growing and most active society in the LBS community despite being the youngest, having gained over 600 LBS telegram members in the last 8 months and averaging one large event per month. More recently we have put together our first ever annual Blockchain event, hosting 250+ students across 8 events with 20 speakers and panellists.

#### Our Beliefs as a Delegate

* Bringing the Entrepreneurial Perspective to the Maker Protocol: [London Business School entrepreneurs have raised $4B of funding in 2021](https://www.businessleader.co.uk/london-business-school-alumni-raise-almost-4bn-in-2021/)-- through a combination of the location, openness to entrepreneurship, emphasis on teamwork, open access to co-founders, advisors, and investors, and limitless showcasing opportunities, LBS has been able to create over [560 companies so far.](https://www.london.edu/faculty-and-research/institute-of-entrepreneurship-and-private-capital/insights-and-news/spotlight)
* Need for decentralisation: The London Blockchain Society has been carefully trying to educate LBS students and beyond about the merits of decentralisation. We cover everything from Blockchain 101 workshops to more specific market research such as the DAO tooling landscape. We are also currently in the process of organising hackathons to encourage blockchain development. 
* Growth of the MakerDAO ecosystem: We are looking forward to fostering the development of blockchain based initiatives and businesses that are built in partnership with MakerDAO. The LBS Blockchain Society understands the importance of connecting the crypto ecosystem to Real World Assets to improve the overall stability of the ecosystem. We as a group have a strong understanding of what constitutes strong yield-generating real-world assets – and have experience across industries ranging from the more prominent RWAs such as real estate to more specific ones such as supply-chain financing (tokenised income streams for YouTube creators) and even carbon-credits.

#### Why Should MKR Holders Delegate to London Business School?

LBS is home to the global leaders of tomorrow. Consistently ranking among the top 5 business schools globally, LBS students come from and place in top firms around the world. LBS students are experts in subject matters ranging from financial markets to artificial intelligence and organisational theory. Given the diversity of cultural and professional backgrounds amongst the student cohort, LBS students are extremely entrepreneurial by nature. As mentioned above, 560 companies have been founded by LBS alumni, including unicorns such as HelloFresh, Feedzai, Wayflyer, Lonely Planet, and many more.

We actively support MakerDAO’s ambition to fund projects that make positive and tangible changes in the world today- particularly projects that may be on a smaller scale, but that could have an outsized impact if scaled. We believe in creating a better, more sustainable, more equal world for our global society, and are dedicated to using our skillsets to make this happen.

The current Research Team leadership has experience across portfolio management at JP Morgan, research at the Reserve Bank of Australia and research at Europe's most prominent Web3 VC Fabric Ventures. This unique mix of backgrounds, as well as the diverse backgrounds of our peers, will help LBS Blockchain in making diligent voting decisions regarding the protocols future. Before each vote, the research team will present a summary of the ongoing discussion to the executive committee and members of the society, and together we will vote on the final LBS Blockchain decision. 

Given that LBS is a graduate school, most of us already have 5-10 years of professional work experience at large, global organisations and institutions, we believe that being a delegator will allow us to help the MakerDAO community identify the right projects to fund. Using our global network, our understanding of business models, and our entrepreneurial mindset, we believe we are in a unique position to help source and evaluate these types of projects. In fact, the LBS motto is even, “To have a profound impact on the way the world does business”.

At a higher level, as a Blockchain Society, we will aim to connect the industry to talent, working as a facilitator in both the professional development of our students and tapping in to available Web3 talent at LBS and our extended networks. This will enable the next generation of crypto and blockchain focused businesses to have a profound impact on financial systems, supply chains, computational systems and art, just to name a few. There is a clear synergy here between the organisational needs of Maker and the funnel of talent which our society can leverage.

Given all these factors, we believe that the LBS Blockchain Society would be an ideal candidate for the MakerDAO delegate program.

### Conflicts of Interest

The LBS Blockchain Society currently does not have any material conflicts of interest. As a society we do not hold any other cryptocurrencies nor do we currently take in membership fees. We agree to keep the MakerDAO society updated should any conflicts of interest arise.

We have read and agree to the [Delegate Code of Conduct](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/recognised-delegate-code-of-conduct/9384) and agree to carefully abide by all the points entailed.

### Waiver of liability

By delegating to LBS Blockchain, you acknowledge and agree that LBS Blockchain will participate on a best efforts basis and will not be liable for any form of damages related to participation in the Maker Protocol, or MakerDAO.
