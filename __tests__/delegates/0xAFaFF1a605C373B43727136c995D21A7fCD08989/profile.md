## Delegate Statement 

### About me

* Many of you might know me from [Twitter](https://twitter.com/hasufl). I would describe myself as a first-principles thinker and investor with a decade+ time horizon on the Defi and crypto space.
* I currently lead Strategy at [Flashbots](https://github.com/flashbots/pm) and collaborate on research with [Paradigm](https://www.paradigm.xyz/).
* I co-host the [Uncommon Core podcast](https://uncommoncore.co/podcast/) with Su Zhu.
* I’m a long-term MKR holder and supporter of MakerDAO and have been thinking and writing about the project for years

## My values and initiatives

### Solving MakerDAO’s principal-agent problem

Organizations in general, but especially more flat ones like MakerDAO, tend to suffer from the [principal-agent problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal%E2%80%93agent_problem). Specifically, Maker’s workforce (the CUs) are agents who work on behalf of their principals (the MKR holders). However, in the absence of managerial oversight, these agents don’t share the same interests as their principals, and the principals have neither the necessary information nor incentives to intervene. For a good read on the topic, especially regarding DAOs, I recommend [Prof. Andy Hall’s post](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/research-driven-insights-about-dao-governance/12471).

In the context of MakerDAO, this principal-agent problem materializes as follows:

* CUs get to make their own budgets and set their own roadmaps without proper oversight; there is very little accountability to MKR holders, and offboarding CUs or even individual facilitators has been a struggle
* MKR holders are supposed to make very complex decisions they are neither equipped nor financially incentivized to make; as a result, CUs get virtually free reign over the protocol, and no one sets a high-level strategic roadmap for Maker as a whole

To combat these problems, MakerDAO has created the delegate system. While the existing delegate system makes some steps in the right direction (e.g., ability to delegate MKR at all), it fails at what is arguably the most critical piece: to address the principal-agent problem and align the incentives between MKR holders and their delegates.

Today,

* delegates get paid by the DAO based on vanity metrics (e.g. vote participation) not the quality of their decisions. The latter would require delegates to divide labor amongst themselves and become domain experts focused on a small part of the DAO (e.g., financials, marketing, RWA, operations, workforce, etc.)
* The potential salary for delegates is much too small to attract the talent we need in these key decision-making roles.

Hence I propose to create a system of executive delegates (or super delegates) who, on behalf of MKR holders, are in charge of

* steering the DAO in the long-term and setting a coherent vision
* holding CUs accountable to MKR holders

These executive delegates would work for Maker full-time and are properly aligned with executive-level compensation and MKR grants/options. They are not necessarily the same as today’s delegates and can be voted in, e.g., on one-year terms and voted out anytime.

It is impressive what Maker has achieved as a headless organization, but we are hitting the scaling limit of this approach. It is time to create an incentive system that will attract the best strategy and leadership talent in the industry to steer Maker for the long term.

### Toward data-driven decision making

One of the most important yet underrated and underexplored aspects of DAO governance is managing the treasury. Any DAO can be seen as a resource allocation problem yet decision-makers lack the right framework to even think about the problem, let alone the information to make good decisions.

For example,

* How much capital buffer do we need?
* Which CUs are profitable vs. unprofitable for the DAO?
* Should we burn MKR, print MKR, or do nothing at all?
* How much should we value future profits vs. profits we can make today?
* Should we raise a strategic investment round, and if yes, at what terms?
* Should we raise money in a fixed-rate debt offering?
* Should we use incentives to grow, and if yes, where?

In absence of a strong framework for treasury management, we are left to defer to our gut feeling, and we have not been doing a good job at it. As a starting point for discussion, @monetsupply and I [have created such a framework for treasury management in Defi](https://uncommoncore.co/a-new-mental-model-for-defi-treasuries/). In essence, we propose to run Maker with the goal of maximizing MKR holder value and putting each dollar of revenue to its best possible use.

Applied to MakerDAO, our framework suggests we should

* never rely on equity offerings to cover capital shortfalls (as we did in March 2020) but instead build a much bigger surplus buffer, minimum 5-10% of all DAI outstanding
* suspend all buybacks and dividend payments for the foreseeable future
* heavily invest in future growth, possibly by doing a debt offering
* explore the option of a strategic sale to incentive key ecosystem or growth partners

Of course, our framework is all but complete and many of the above questions need constant evaluation by trained professionals. To this end, I want to encourage the creation of a treasury CU that becomes the “financial brain” of MakerDAO and creates data-driven recommendations to executive delegates and other key decision-makers.

I have since learned about the new Strategic Finance CU and from early conversations and evaluating their existing work, it seems that they could possibly play this role going forward.

## Conflicts of Interest

* I don’t have any investments or incentives that should impact my role as a delegate at the current time.
* MKR is one of my biggest holdings. I consider myself very strongly aligned with the long-term success of the project
* I have also read, and agree with, the [Recognised Delegate Code of Conduct](https://manual.makerdao.com/governance/what-is-delegation/delegates-code).
