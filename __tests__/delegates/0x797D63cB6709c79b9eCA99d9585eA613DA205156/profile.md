### Core Values

* Serve as a rational, reliable, optimistic, unbiased and pragmatic voice within the MakerDAO community, providing value through meaningful participation in community discussions and reliable voting.
* Educate the University of Chicago campus and the broader University community about the Maker project + facilitate collaboration on new Maker initiatives.
* Help MakerDAO continue to build a sustainable and enduring community that enables the creation of a more financially free and sustainable future for all.


### Delegate Statement

GM! We are ChicagoDAO, a burgeoning DAO at The University of Chicago that connects the various blockchain clubs and communities on campus. As of now, we currently have representation from students in the undergraduate college, law school, and business school. We have ≈25 core contributors and ≈150 community members. We will be opening up our DAO to alumni and the broader campus over the summer and have numerous initiatives we will be working on this summer, from creating a bespoke DAO tooling platform to planning a conference in fall. Our current working groups include a Dev team, Trade/Quant Team, Internal Ops Team, Outreach Team, Research team, and an External Governance team. 

Our delegated tokens are managed by our External Governance team. Within this team each protocol has one to two protocol leads who keep the broader team abreast of new developments and are the central point of contact for that protocol. We meet weekly to discuss new proposals and vote in a simple, equal weighted ballot where each measure must have two-thirds of the External Governance team voting ‘yes’ to pass. Currently we have Compound and Uniswap delegated from a16z. We are excited to get started with Maker soon!

Our discussions bring together students from varying backgrounds and areas of expertise. On our External Governance team we have multiple developers with experience on different blockchains, experienced traders, former and aspiring lawyers, former financial regulators, public policy analysts and more. We believe that this diversity of backgrounds allows us to have a holistic view of protocols and the potential impact of new proposals.

Our key initiatives within the External Governance team are to:
* Stay abreast of new developments within each protocol
* Actively participate in discussions and votes for all proposals
* Draft and put forward new proposals when appropriate
* Be an evangelist for the protocols and communities we are involved with

As delegates, we will be reliable stewards and work diligently to ensure the future growth and success of MakerDAO. By delegating to ChicagoDAO you are affirming the value of interdisciplinary teams and partnerships across industry and academia.

### Conflicts of Interest

* ChicagoDAO takes part in governance of other projects. Currently these are Uniswap and Compound

We have read and agree to abide by the[ Delegate Code of Conduct](https://manual.makerdao.com/governance/what-is-delegation/delegates-code).

### Waiver of Liability

By delegating to ChicagoDAO you acknowledge that ChicagoDAO will participate in MakerDAO governance on a best efforts basis and will not be liable for damages of any form related to participation in MakerDAO, the Maker Protocol or any other activities arising from this delegation.
