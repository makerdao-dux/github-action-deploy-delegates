## Delegate Statement


### About Me

-	I am a lawyer and legal academic from New Zealand, specializing in law and technology. I am specifically interested in DeFi, decentralized governance, and the broader regulatory paradigm for emerging technologies. 

-	From private practice, I have experience advising large corporates and organizations about a range of strategy and legal issues relating to technology. I am a problem solver by trade and a moderate by temperament. 

-	I am a long-term small MKR holder, having watched the project evolve since 2019. I deeply care about Maker, and believe in its potential to sit at the heart of a thriving DeFi ecosystem. I want to dedicate my time, knowledge and skills to help bring that vision about.

## My Values and Priorities 


### An emphasis on long-term strategy and growth.

-	Maker is at a critical juncture. There is a real opportunity in this market to cement DAI’s place as the leading decentralized stablecoin, and Maker’s place as the standard-setting protocol in DeFi. Given the huge scale of that opportunity, I believe that Maker should keep the big picture in mind and double down on growth.  

-	Growth does not and should not mean the wanton squandering of resources during a bear market. Instead, it looks like Maker proactively developing internal capabilities and external integrations. It looks like generating revenue from idle assets by monetizing our balance sheet, continuing with the work of relationship-building with top-tier RWA partners, and taking early market share on L2s like StarkNet, Optimism and Arbitrum. 

-	One of my motivators for becoming a Recognized Delegate is to combat the myopia that tends to pervade the crypto world during a bear market. It always bears repeating that the TAM for Maker is ridiculously large. To capture that opportunity and maximise value for MKR holders, we must continue building, scaling, and hardening the protocol with an eye to the future. 

### Improving governance and organizational decision-making. 

-	While Maker is light years ahead of other DAOs, we have a long way to go to build a truly effective organization and governance system. As others have variously pointed out, we have several structural issues at Maker: a lack of cohesive strategy, too much complexity, broad apathy on the part of MKR holders, etc. 

- I support shrinking the governance footprint, particularly with smaller MKR holders in mind. It is self-evidently impossible for most MKR holders to keep up with the forum, let alone make informed decisions on complex governance decisions. The spiral of complexity also makes it harder for delegates to effectively size and weigh decisions, and for other stakeholders to understand how Maker works. I welcome initiatives like [this recent proposal from SES](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/project-based-budgeting/17121), for instance, to help combat these problems. 

-	Balancing meaningful decentralization with operational effectiveness is in many ways Maker’s primary challenge. These are difficult questions, particularly in a complicated protocol like Maker, and I do not think that one-dimensional or maximalist perspectives help resolve them. We have lessons to learn from the corporate governance literature, and things to figure out on our own about how to craft the right incentives for effective decentralized governance. 

### Providing an independent voice and fact-based scrutiny.

-	I think it is pivotal to Maker’s governance that delegates can apply a critical and fact-based lens to each vote, without pressure to vote in a particular way. For that reason, I want to make it clear that Frontier Research will be participating in governance as a fully independent delegate. 

-	Accordingly, I will not be joining the Endgame Party as an Endgame Delegate. I certainly do not ‘oppose’ the Endgame Plan per se: I support the general goal of ossifying core functions and making them more resilient, for instance. However, the Endgame Plan is a complex proposal with many moving parts that each merit individual scrutiny. I have a track record of asking some unpopular but important questions on this and other topics (see [here](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/the-endgame-plan-part-3-the-endgame-decentralized-workforce/15737/4), [here](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/discussion-is-gfxs-interest-protocol-a-direct-challenge-to-maker/15577) and [here](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/end-game-summary-part-5/16759/5) as examples). MKR holders deserve independent representation, particularly on protocol-defining shifts such as the Endgame. 

-	Finally, I see part of the value I can bring as an independent delegate is that of a bridge-builder and pragmatist. I am concerned about the increasing politicization and polarization of Maker and do not want to see the community fractured into ‘sides’ or ‘teams’. Much more unites us at Maker than divides us, and crafting a long-term vision should help to underline that reality.  

### Conflicts of Interest

-	ETH and MKR are my only significant (>5% total value) crypto holdings. 
-	I have no investments or interests that should impact my role as a delegate.
-	I have been contributing research and analysis to GovAlpha, largely applying political science theory/analysis to Maker's governance systems. This work was strictly ad-hoc, limited in scope and I was not a member of the GovAlpha CU. I have ceased my contributions to GovAlpha and will not seek paid work at Maker beyond my role as a Recognized Delegate.  
-	I have read, agree with, and agree to abide by the [Delegate Code of Conduct](https://manual.makerdao.com/delegation/for-delegates/delegates-code).

### Waiver of Liability

By delegating to Frontier Research you acknowledge and agree that I will not be held liable for any damages or losses caused by my participation in the Maker Protocol or because of any votes cast or actions taken while acting as a delegate. I do not have a fiduciary or any other obligation to you as a result of your delegation of MKR to the Frontier Research delegation contract. By delegating your MKR you accept the outcome of votes made on your behalf by Frontier Research, and specifically agree that at all times you have complete control over the delegated assets by adding or removing your MKR from the delegation contract.
