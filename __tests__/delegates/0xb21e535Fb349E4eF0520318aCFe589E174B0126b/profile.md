### Delegate Statement
#### Growth over Profit

Despite already being considered as a blue chip in the DeFi-ecosystem, we believe Maker is still super early in the game and we should absolutely focus on growing our footprint instead of being profitable.

#### Decentralization
We are far away from being decentralized. That’s okay. Just to give you some idea how we feel where we should go to

* Multiple Core Units caring about the same domain is desirable. Just having one Growth CU is not where we should be on the long run, same for CUs doing engineering (we are a lot better already here, but also far from perfect)
* We need a lot more collateral types. We already overdid this with crypoassets (onboarded collateral which was just not worth the effort/cost), but we think there are a lot of RWA we can onboard on the on the long run
* There has been some talking about SEC-compliance and other US-focused regulatory stuff. we are totally not saying that is bad, but we are missing the notion of Maker being a trans-national thing. 
* Delegation helped us a lot on letting execs pass. But it also revealed that a single delegate/whale can flip any vote. We need more voter participation and for that most probably a lot more delegates to make this happen.

#### Trust
We are usually trusting in people, and not caring a lot about KPIs. We know that this is bad, but it worked well enough for us. We think we do need some standardized way on how we go with accounting, budgets and all of that. Probably not urgent now, but if we don’t prepare it will be too late at some point and everything will be a total mess. We already see traces [here](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/flip-flop-flap-delegate-llc-platform/9106/31).

### About us

We are a group of MKR holders who prefer to stay unknown. We have been following @ultraschuppi for more than a year now and believe we can help the protocol by serving as a Recognized Delegate especially because we are not traceable. As for all human interactions a _real human_ is needed, we are going to have @ultraschuppi as an advisor to our platform, empowered with interacting with all other parts of the DAO. Onchain activity will be done by us.

In general, we will go with the advice we get from him.

As a rule of thumb: We will vote in favor for every exec that gets promoted on chain by the Governance Facilitators that does not feel dangerous to the protocol even if that exec contains changes that we voted against in the previous onchain poll. 

### Conflicts of Interest

We hold positions on several DeFi projects, but not to the same degree as we hold MKR. We are not participating in any other DAO and do not plan to do that.

We have read and agree to the [Delegate Code of Conduct](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/recognised-delegate-code-of-conduct/9384).

### Waiver of liability

By delegating to us, you acknowledge and agree that we participate on a best efforts basis and will not be liable for any form of damages related to my participation in the Maker Protocol or MakerDAO.
