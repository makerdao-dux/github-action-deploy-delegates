### Delegate Statement

In Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), the visions and ideas which new technologies are developed from should be embraced and nurtured. Students are encouraged to explore and trailblaze on any potential new frontiers.

As blockchain technology is still maturing and adoption is rapidly increasing, continuous education and development should be established. For mainstream adoption to be achieved, strategic planning as well as proper decision making and marketing is required.

Therefore, by establishing a research lab (EPI) to synergise the growth of MakerDAO, by governance participation, with the exposure to blockchain technology and decentralised finance, this would provide a mutually beneficial symbiotic relationship between MakerDAO and the University.

The delegator will be led by a University researcher with student volunteers (Research lab), the research lab is expected to be fully vested in the governance of MakerDAO and communications with delegators will be communicated on a frequent and timely basis.

The research lab will be solely responsible for Governance matters to MakerDAO with assistance from other Faculty members on other matters such as, Research, Education, Business Development and Web3 developments.

HKUST-EPI has plans to participate in governance matters in other protocols.

This research lab will share updates regarding new proposals internally and will discuss them before reaching a decisive vote. This decision making process will take place internally via simple majority either in person or via electronic communication mediums. Decisions will be made in time to ascertain full participation in the governance proposals.

The governance initiatives are:

* Active participation in discussion forums
* Initiating new improvements proposals
* Monitoring of news and updates
* Seek consultations with respective faculty members or with collaborating external parties
* Communication with internal team members
* Open communications and Q&A with delegators when time permits

HKUST-EPI sincerely encourages all MakerDAO stakeholders to delegate with the research lab to have a greater stake and voting power in the decision making process. By leveraging on our resources and connections to bring the protocol to greater glory. With our research lab of individuals with unique perspectives, industry experience and knowledge, rest assured that the choice of delegating with HKUSE-EPI, as your preferred recognized delegate, will be a positive experience.

### Conflicts of Interest

* Team members may have small stake in MakerDAO
* Consultations with other teams in charge of governance of other protocols
* Consultations with external collaborators

HKUST-EPI has read and agreed to abide by the [Delegate Code of Conduct](https://manual.makerdao.com/governance/what-is-delegation/delegates-code).
