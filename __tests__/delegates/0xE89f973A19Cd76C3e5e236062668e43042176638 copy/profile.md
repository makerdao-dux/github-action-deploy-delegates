### Core Values

Simplify the core protocol, eliminate or externalize low-value complexity. This is essential for a DAO and also creates more space in our “complexity budget” to onboard high value features.

Developing sustainable, decentralized systems. I fully support reaching an end game where the protocol can run itself with simple oversight.

Ensure the interest Maker holders are represented. I welcome communication with all holders.

### Delegate Statement

My goal is to turn Maker into a trillion-dollar entity that is easy to understand and decentralized. I am committed to helping grow Maker into a sustainable, profitable system.

To do this, I will emphasize reducing complexity and building easy to evaluate processes, to ensure that both delegates and Maker holders can understand the protocol and it’s governance. Simplicity is essential to decentralization, both to avoid hidden centralization points and to identify potential weaknesses and waste. I am a believer in incremental improvement, so I am just as interested in little ideas to make things run more smoothly as big sweeping changes.

I will support proposals that provide strong risk-adjusted returns, with clear metrics to evaluate their success. I will object to proposals with unjustifiably high costs or that don’t fit into the wider Maker ecosystem and it’s budget.

As a delegate, I commit to providing honesty, transparency and openness to both Maker holders and the community.

### Conflicts of Interest

I have 5 figure positions in Eth and Truefi’s tokens. I will abstain from any votes related to Truefi. I do not derive significant income from any potential partner or competitor of Maker.

### Waiver of Liability

By delegating to me, you acknowledge and agree that I participate on a best efforts basis and will not be liable for any form of damages related to my participation in the Maker Protocol or MakerDAO.
