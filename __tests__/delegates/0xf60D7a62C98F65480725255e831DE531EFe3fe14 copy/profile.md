### Delegate Statement

GFX Labs is committed to helping protocols grow and evolve. The current landscape of protocols, DAOs, and protocol governance is extremely nascent.

While MakerDAO has been on the bleeding edge of debt management, stablecoins, and governance there is still much to improve. Our team is comprised of heavy defi users, regular governance participants, and core community members of various protocols. While our predominant experience has been in Compound and Uniswap, we are excited to expand our efforts further into MakerDAO. We look forward to applying our learnings from other protocols to MakerDAO and build cross-protocol relationships.

**GFX Labs isn’t a fund. We don’t hold positions. We are a team of builders who love DeFi.** Our participation in governance is rooted in a desire to see DeFi overtake legacy finance. We promise to be active participants. We’ll explain not only when we agree, but most importantly, when we disagree. As first-hand participants in governance know how frustrating it is to work on a proposal, receive limited comments, only to have the proposal shot down at launch. Our door will always be open to those who share the passion for DeFi that we have.

### Conflicts of Interest

GFX Labs may from time to time be engaged as a delegate on other protocols. All governance participation is public and done through the same wallet.
