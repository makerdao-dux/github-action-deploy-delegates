## Delegate Statement

I'm the Founder of Acre of America, an impact investment management & advisory firm working at the intersection of new technologies & rural problems from headquarters in Hudson, New York, USA. 

**ACREinvest** is our new blockchain venture focused on creating compelling Web3 infrastructure, virtual network services and social incentives for DAOs and other peer-to-peer permissionless stakeholders. We recently launched [ACRE DAOs](https://www.acredaos.com/), a Web3 portal for a decentralized impact investment club and its related community ERC-20 token: [ACRE Impact](https://etherscan.io/token/0x77dDA3913e57F1879eF2FFb4cC339E670deEe67c).

Our Mission at ACREinvest is to regenerate the way capital markets work & for whom.

I'm excited to apply two decades of prior legal experience in derivatives and commodities markets to the world of DeFi, and MakerDAO specifically. New products and regulatory policy in markets have long been a hallmark of my work and professional fascination. I've been down the crypto rabbit hole full-time since 2017 and have been an avid follower-fan of MakerDAO since that time. 

Until now I have not had the capacity to dig-in actively on governance, so I'm thrilled to have a wonderful team in place at Acre of America to provide me with this opportunity to nerd out with you all. 

Further, I am keen to inform the wider world about this important work and experimental process by  publishing online content for a general finance savvy audience that is DeFi and crypto curious.

I began my legal career as a Corporate Associate in the derivatives practice group at Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP in New York City after graduating from Spelman College and the Yale Law School. Clients included the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (“ISDA”) and as ISDA’s U.S. Outside Counsel I coordinated the work of several sell-side working groups that published documentation and resolved legal, commercial, regulatory and operational issues facing derivatives markets, including for the then-emerging credit derivatives market and launch of the Euro. 

In later roles I gained extensive deal and transactional experience supporting the fixed-income derivatives, currencies/FX, derivatives prime brokerage and energy trading businesses at Goldman Sachs; derivatives and physical commodities trading at Lehman Brothers; and global commodities merchant trading businesses at Castleton Commodities International. 

### Conflicts of Interest

Acre of America does not have any significant conflicts of interest at this time. I pledge to keep the community updated on any developments with our products and services that could present a conflict of interest, and will also inform of personal conflicts that would be appropriate to disclose as a result of any legal client representation or tradfi-style client advisory/asset management obligations.

I have read and agree to abide by the [Delegate Code of Conduct. ](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/recognised-delegate-code-of-conduct/9384)
