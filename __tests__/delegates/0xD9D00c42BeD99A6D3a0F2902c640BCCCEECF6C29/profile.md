### Key Info

Name: pvl
Delegate Address: 0xD9D00c42BeD99A6D3a0F2902c640BCCCEECF6C29  
Discourse: **@pvl**  
Discord: @pvl#3939 (for now mainly active in [the Endgame Discord](https://discord.gg/sYnXP2r5))  
Bird's-eye view on Miro: https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVOxT0KgU=/?share_link_id=72228391399  

Read the Ethereum Whitepaper in 2015. Was involved with the Tezos community in its early days. Did some UX work for [Radar Relay](https://radar.tech).

Served on the [Tribe a.k.a. Fei DAO](https://docs.tribedao.xyz) Optimistic Approval multisig committee, which successfully served as a testbed before Tribe's transition to Orca Pod-based Liquid governance in May '22. During its 8-month run OA reviewed and voted on 130+ actions, including reviewing the input of the security audit vendor to verify the work done before wiring payment.

Currently on the [Gro protocol](https://www.gro.xyz/) Treasury management committee with a mandate to execute on pre-agreed (‘whitelisted’) treasury deployments, run due diligence and negotiations, submit proposals to the DAO for voting, and instruct the DAO multisig to act on those instructions.

### Core Values

Bringing in background in machine learning, TradFi financial consulting and some DeFi I recognise as equally important for Maker's foreseeable future nurturing DAO culture conducive to building trust of current and potential Maker products users while integrating into the DAO practice

* web3-native intelligence for protocol stewardship, collateral onboarding and Treasury management;

* provably optimal infrastructure funding mechanisms;

* web3-native community support tools

thus fulfilling the protocol's mission as a provider of decentralised financial products.

### Delegate Statement

Ironically Maker, as DeFi at large, turns out to be in the trust business. It’s just that trust here concerns DAO's technical and organisational reliability, a stablecoin being a trust-driven financial vehicle. You use DAI as a store of value, a medium of exchange because you’re confident about the technical and cultural sustainability of MakerDAO, its ability to build and maintain stability of its products. Realistically retail users don’t read Github or Discourse — they just have a certain subjective attitude towards the organisation, its products and its prospects.

As shown by a16z cofounder Ben Horowitz in his books  [“What you do is who you are”,](https://a16z.com/book/whatyoudo/) and ["The hard thing about hard things"](https://a16z.com/book/the-hard-thing-about-hard-things/) organisation’s culture codified in its leaders' actions is a crucial ingredient in the whole endeavour’s success or failure. For example, there's a direct link between a leader's arrogance and negligence on the ground level. People learn what's considered admissible in the organisation from a leader's behaviour patterns. Thus, a leader's hubris can well translate into subpar software quality or security breaches. Delegates, as MKR holder's agents, serve here as a mechanism of checks and balances preventing such a course of actions.

As a brief reference here is a brief interview of Ben Horowitz discussing ways of handling culture and crisis at places like Facebook, WeWork and Boeing (the B737 MAX crisis):

With DeFi gradually coming of age MakerDAO must learn to build and maintain user trust in Maker's products beyond the enthusiast user base. As the industry is deeply entangled, DAO members should have a clear and profound understanding of DeFi dynamics at large. At the moment there's little understanding in the industry about under-the-hood economics of even major platforms, let alone emerging ones (which comprise the majority). Basically when we say that e.g. Aave is mature we imply that judging from its track record we can assume that it's highly stable. The subprime mortgage crisis of '08 once again reminded everybody that there is no such thing as stable by default and too mature to fail — thanks to miscalculated risks of structured products on the balance Lehman Brothers, a major Wall St. bank with a 170-year history, went bust. And AIG survived only thanks to the Fed bailout worth $200B (the scale of risk miscalculation!). The whole entangled industry was on the verge of collapse. Without web3-native, not translated from TradFi, tools for insight there's a good chance that we're heading towards a crisis of (relatively) similar scale in DeFi caused by underestimated or miscalculated risks. Meanwhile, DeFi doesn't have the Fed to bail it out.

Maker as any web3 protocol is an evolving shared narrative: it lives simultaneously in two domains open for exploration: onchain transactions and broader user&contributor community interactions. They inform and impact each other in both directions in a myriad of ways creating a bipartite heterogenous living organism. To comprehend and be able to predict this organism means to be able to model and predict evolution of its two integral parts in a coherent, unified way.

My thoughts and proposals on this:

To prove its organisation's trustworthy sustainability, MakerDAO must learn to fund its infrastructure development and maintenance initiatives in the most efficient, optimal way. 

The key task that is up for recurrent solutions within MakerDAO is finding consensus over alternative policy priorities and allocating limited resources (financial and non-financial) accordingly. In other words bridging the discrepancy in perceived subjective value of respective competing policy venues, ideally by measuring it and mapping these subjective values to respective allocations in an optimal Maker’s interests-wise way. One can foresee that without a systematic approach this problem will only exacerbate with the protocol growing more complex with consequent increasing complexity of the protocol’s infrastructure and range of contributing efforts.

Since Maker, as any decentralised fat protocol, is open infrastructure, Maker infrastructure funding is essentially a problem of optimal allocation of limited resources towards public goods. There is a provably optimal way to do it.

Discord and Discourse were not devised with web3 use cases in mind and hence limit the DAO. This community could again be a trailblazer for the industry in adopting web3-native community support platforms.

[Geneva](https://geneva.com) integrates token-gated rooms and wallet connect on top of chat rooms, forum rooms, audio rooms, video rooms, and broadcast rooms in one platform with all standard features. They promise in the near future more web3-native stuff around tokenomics-based data feeds enabling [turning networks into economies](https://cdixon.mirror.xyz/977Uy2b3ZWCNjVdHxeaNC2ecYOUS3VPgS2_PwVddiQ0).

[Skiff](https://skiff.com/pages): IPFS-based Docs + Drive + Mail with wallet connect.

As a long-term topic I'd encourage discussing that given escalating USD inflation maybe it'd be wise for Maker to work on stable products pegged to something different than 1 fiat currency, e.g. a basket of commodities. A similar TradFi experiment with [IMF Special Drawing Rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_drawing_rights) has already happened. It might actually become Maker's competitive edge.

### Potential Conflicts of Interest

Other than my involvement with Gro I don’t have any investments or incentives that should impact my role as a delegate at the current time.

### Waiver of liability

I have read and pledge to follow the [Recognized Delegate Code of Conduct](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/recognised-delegate-code-of-conduct/9384). I will do my best to act in Maker's interests. I will maintain communication regarding my stance on the various issues that are voted on.

By delegating to me you acknowledge and agree that @pvl will not be held liable for any damages caused by my participation in the Maker Protocol or because of any votes cast or not cast while acting as a delegate.
